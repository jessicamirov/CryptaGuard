In recent years, the internet has become essential for shopping, banking, social media, and sharing sensitive information.
Many websites rely on a single central server, posing security risks.
Our project addresses this by developing a user-friendly web app for secure file transfer.

We combine peer-to-peer communication with asymmetric encryption for best security.
P2P allows direct communication without central servers, reducing data exposure risks.
Asymmetric encryption uses public and private keys to ensure only authorized access.

Our platform is accessible to all users, from individuals to large organizations, using efficient technologies like Preact, Node.js, and Tailwind.
The website offers file encryption and secure chat services, enabling safe information sharing.
Users can generate new encryption keys anytime, which are never stored in a database.
Keys are automatically deleted upon leaving the site.
